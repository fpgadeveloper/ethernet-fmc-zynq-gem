Build failures
==============

Check the following if the project fails to build or generate a bitstream:

#. | **Are you using the correct version of Vivado for this version of the repository?**
   | Check the version specified in the Requirements section of the README.md file. Note that this project is regularly updated
     and you may have to refer to an earlier commit of this repo if you are using an older version of Vivado.

#. | **Did you correctly follow the build instructions?**
   | Please check the build instructions carefully as you may have missed a step.

#. | **Did you copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure?**
   | Windows doesn't cope well with long directory structures, so copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure such as
     ``C:\projects\``. When working in long directory structures, you can get errors relating to missing files, particularly files 
     that are normally generated by Vivado (FIFOs, etc).
